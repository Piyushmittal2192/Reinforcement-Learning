### Explore Expolit Deliemma
#### Slot Machine Example 
  Need balance between number of trials we play to collect data and maximise the earnings. i.e. Maximise the winning rate with minimum number of attempts to collect the data on which slot machine gives best results. Expliot the environment via minimum exploration. This is the explore exploit deliemma.
  
  We need a statistics i.e. "Win Ratio" of each slot machine to label which machine will give us maximum winings. But to calculate this ratio, we first have to play the game for n number of times. Then the question comes what is optimal value of "n". We can't always keep on playing just to test which slot machine gives us max win.
